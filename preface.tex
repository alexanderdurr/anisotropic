This thesis is part of a bigger Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) project undertaken by the two closely related companies -- \mbox{Qamcom~Technology~AB}\footnote{Qamcom Technology AB, \url{http://www.qamcom.se}} and \mbox{Amparo~Solutions~AB}\footnote{Amparo Solutions AB, \url{http:///www.amparosolutions.se}}. The goal of this project is to develop a traffic information system capable of delivering information in real-time to drivers, authorities and road maintenance personnel. The wireless sensor network proposed is evaluated in this project for different applications in an intelligent transportation system.

\subsection*{Acknowledgements}\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Acknowledgements}
In the course of preparing this masters thesis I have realised that I am in debt to numerous people whose help I could not have done without. I would therefore like to thank everyone at Qamcom~Technology~AB, Amparo~Solutions~AB, Mantra~Communication~AB for their interest in my work -- a heartfelt thanks to my advisers Patrik Bohlin and Henrik Linell. My examiner Professor Erik Str\"{o}m should not only be credited for all his help during this thesis, but also for introducing me to the deeper realms of communication systems. 

A mathematician named Alfr\'{e}d R\'{e}nyi once stated that ``a mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems''. Alfr\'{e}d's theorem is equally true for physicists and engineers though the output might differ. During this thesis I have consumed an estimated \mbox{300 cups} or \mbox{60 litres} of coffee and for that I would like to thank everyone in the coffee making chain, from the coffee bean pickers in the highlands of Kenya to the employees at Qamcom. Without any single one of them, this thesis would still be in the process of being written.

I would also like to express my deep gratitude to all the researchers in this field for making their work available to me, through publications and Internet. My family has supported me through all of my studies -- for that I am really thankful. Lastly I'd like to send my gratitude to those who have proofread my work -- you have all given me a severe headache.
