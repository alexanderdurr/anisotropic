# Vehicle Detection using Anisotropic Magnetoresistors
Master's thesis project, Chalmers University of Technology
GÃ¶teborg, Sweden, 2007

> A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) of anisotropic magnetoresistor sensors offers a low-cost alternative
to other traffic measurement technologies. The WSNs offer better reliability than other
solutions, they offer more information, can be deployed quickly and be reused. In this thesis the
sensor algorithms used for detection, velocity estimation, queue detection and classification in
such a network are evaluated based on simulated and measured data. A number of algorithms are
evaluated and the results are compared. A new algorithm for speed estimation using two sensor
nodes is proposed and evaluated. It is found to be much better than earlier algorithms, requiring
a signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 20 dB less than the traditional algorithm.

This project was lost and so this is an attempt to resurrect it. 
The `tex` files were the only files that remained from the project. LaTeX packages and images had to be recovered from [the PDF](https://www.google.se/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&sqi=2&ved=0ahUKEwilrZaN7sLRAhVG_SwKHQldDzkQFggaMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fpublications.lib.chalmers.se%2Frecords%2Ffulltext%2F70865.pdf&usg=AFQjCNHpUYM8dIm8N8GjDdl59emnOM6K_Q&sig2=LsMaISIvMW6iBpcPO0zJOQ&bvm=bv.144224172,d.bGg) using [extract_images](https://github.com/martisak/extract_images).
